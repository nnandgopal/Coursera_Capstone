This is not an isolated case. On numerous accounts, I have seen my friends and family go out of their way to find a good Indian restaurant. I would like to use location data as well as some demographic data, to reccomend a location in LA that is a strong market for a restaurant serving Indian food. To do this, I will be categorizing the neighborhoods in LA, and then identifying restaurants, and specifically Indian restaurants. I will also use 2010 census data to identify areas with higher population of people with Indian restaurants with low ratings, for the location of the new restaurant. \n\n## Data \nI will be using the foursquare API, and cesus data from 2010. \n\n\n"
